# Desktop Video 12.7 SDK (Linux only)

This repository is to archive the SDK published by Blackmagic.  The source can be found at  https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/family/capture-and-playback .  I am limiting this archive it to Linux only, since that is my main interest.  They do happen to release Mac and Windows files, but I have no need for those right now.  Let me know if you are interested in an archive of those.
